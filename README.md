# Python-Basic-Calculator
This is a simple project I decided to do on my free time.
It is a basic calculator project that I decided to make to learn more about functions, *args, and etc.
It is definitely not the cleanest code nor is it the best way to do, but this project helped me learn more about those topics.

Note: this is a terminal program which means you need to download it, run it, and it will be displayed in the terminal.
